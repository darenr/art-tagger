While abstraction is evident around the world in art and functional objects, its art-historical significance is as a category for 20th-century Western art that moved away from the faithful representation of nature. The origins of abstraction are commonly located in the works of [J.M.W. Turner](/artist/joseph-mallord-william-turner), [Gustave Courbet](/artist/gustave-courbet), [Édouard Manet](/artist/edouard-manet), the [Impressionists](/gene/impressionism), as well as in the early 1900s, when [Paul Cézanne](/artist/paul-cezanne)'s stylized, flattened forms influenced what would eventually be called the [Cubism](/gene/cubism) of [Pablo Picasso](/artist/pablo-picass) and [Georges Braque](artist/georges-braque). Arguably the first abstract art movement, Cubism would prove foundational to countless branches of abstract art, including [Futurism](/gene/futurism) in Italy, the non-objective abstraction of [Wassily Kandinsky](/artist/wassily-kandinsky), [Kasimir Malevich](/artist/kasimir-malevich), and [Piet Mondrian](/artist/piet-mondrian), and the [Purism](/gene/purism) of [Le Corbusier](/artist/le-corbusier) and [Amédée Ozenfant](/artist/amedee-ozenfant). Though the intervening decades have seen returns to representation in different movements, virtually all of the dominant art forms of the latter half of the 20th century—including [Abstract Expressionism](/gene/abstract-expressionism), [Neo-Dada](/gene/neo-dada), [Pop Art](/gene/pop-art), [Minimalism](/gene/minimalism), and [Conceptual Art](/gene/conceptual-art)—have embraced the power and aesthetic of formal abstraction in lieu of literal representation.

Starting from this truth it is impossible for anyone to express anything essentially real by imitating its exterior surface."" —[Constantin Brancusi](/artist/constantin-brancusi)_

In the early 20th century, many avant-garde sculptors pushed the bounds of accepted modes of representation, abandoning faithfulness to the visible world in favor of abstraction. The question many artists asked was no longer how to reproduce the world as it appeared, but rather how to best express realities of life (sensed and theorized) through forms. Ever since, abstract sculpture has offered particularly fertile ground for experiments in shape, proportion, and technique, as well as for the embrace of non-traditional sculpting methods (apart from casting, welding, or direct carving), such as industrial manufacturing processes, plastic moulds, and even [3D printing](/gene/3d-printed). Modern strands of abstract sculpture include [Concrete Art](/gene/concrete-art)'s mathematically precise and elegant forms, the strict geometry and forceful presence of [Minimalist](/gene/minimalism) objects, and [Kinetic Sculpture](/gene/kinetic-sculpture)'s embodiment of movement and physical forces."

Of all the art battles and debates of the 20th century, none has been as divisive as that between abstract and figurative art. With the emergence of [Cubism](/gene/cubism) and the movements and artists that followed it, as well as the writings of American critics like Clement Greenberg, the progression towards a non-objective abstraction (wherein no objects could be recognized) became the dominant story of modern art; in turn, figuration became discredited, labeled as retrograde and aligned with enemy politics (read: Communism and [Socialist Realism](/gene/socialist-realism), or the National Socialist dictate of figurative art). Yet in reality, for many artists throughout the 20th century and into the present day, the dividing line between abstraction and figuration was much more porous, leading these artists to create paintings and works on paper somewhere in between the two. In the immediate post-war period in Europe, [Francis Bacon](/artist/francis-bacon) walked what he called the “tightrope between abstraction and figuration” to ask existential questions about the image of man, while contemporary artists like [Cecily Brown](/artist/cecily-brown) continue the tradition of [Willem de Kooning](/artist/willem-de-kooning), pushing their figures even closer to complete abstraction."

These include precise techniques for carving and casting free-standing sculptures and the undertaking of large-scale urban building projects, which stemmed from access to and the skilled use of materials ranging from marble to bronze to concrete. “Man is the measure of all things” was a central maxim in Greek culture, and as such, Greek artists scrutinized human forms closely to create idealized Classical figures. They also presented detailed depictions of mythological narratives, which often accentuated the human traits of the pantheon of gods. Roman artists borrowed heavily from these narratives, while contributing many of their own. These developments in art were accompanied by new forms of political life, most notably the form of democracy that emerged in Athens and reached its height during the 5th century BC (the Parthenon was built 447-432 BC). Athens and its neighbors in the eastern Mediterranean participated in a seafaring culture that resulted in a great amount of cultural and economic exchange. Under the Roman Empire (27 BC-395 AD), territories stretching from the present-day Middle East to Scotland were brought under centralized rule. Beginning in the 4th century, cultural and political power shifted to the east of the empire, with Constantinople becoming the capital in 330 and much of the western territory falling into the hands of northern European conquerors thereafter. Around this time, Christianity began to supplant pagan religion—at first persecuted by the state but in the 4th century becoming the official religion under Constantine, which led to the growth of a new body of iconography that would flourish in [Byzantine Art](/gene/byzantine-art)."

While the [Early Renaissance](/gene/early-renaissance) period in Italy drew from Byzantine aesthetics, the [High Renaissance](/gene/high-renaissance) returned to forms from classical antiquity. This shift was due in part to the development of oil paint in Netherlandish regions and the growing trade of information throughout Europe. In addition to new painting techniques, artists turned toward other areas of study, such as the sciences (which, as a result, also experienced a renewed enthusiasm) and scientific ideas regarding perspective.

The term and the treatment of objects described as such have a controversial history, as many non-Western art objects have been treated as archeological, rather than art historical, artifacts, appearing in natural history museums to this day. Efforts to include this artwork in international exhibitions began in the 1980s with such exhibitions as 1984’s “Primitivism,” at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in which traditional African objects were placed alongside the 20th-century European works they influenced, including those by [Pablo Picasso](/artist/pablo-picasso) and [Max Ernst](/artist/max-ernst). The 1989 exhibition “Magiciens de la Terre,” at Centre Pompidou, Paris, sought to remedy the Eurocentrism surrounding modern art through a balanced presentation of artists spanning all continents but received criticism for its treatment of African and Oceanic artists. Today artists rarely identify with these blanket categories, instead opting for more accurate and specific terms like Native American, Alaska Native and First Nations, Micronesian, Polynesian, or any of the 54 countries and nationalities or hundreds of ethnic groups in the continent of Africa.

Though portraits are generally defined as representations of real individuals intended to capture a likeness, as Freud aptly expresses in the quote above, there is more to a portrait than an exact replication of the subject’s facial features. One of the oldest traditions in art, portraiture has served a variety of purposes, from recording appearances and acting as commemorative gifts, to asserting power. Early portraits preserved likenesses of men after their death, as in Egyptian sarcophagi, death masks, and other [funerary objects](gene/funerary-object). In the [Greek](gene/greek-art) and [Roman](gene/roman-art) periods, statues and coins featured faithful depictions of rulers and distinguished individuals—a convention that was revived during the [Renaissance](gene/renaissance) and after by artists like [Hans Holbein the Younger](artist/hans-holbein-the-younger), [Rembrandt van Rijn](artist/rembrandt-van-rijn) and [Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres](artist/jean-auguste-dominique-ingres). These artists emphasized the subject’s pose, dress, and setting to convey a sense of individual identity or even inner psychology. More than any work, [Leonardo da Vinci](artist/leonard-da-vinci)’s Mona Lisa proved that beyond physical likeness, it is often the portraits' intangible essence—possibly the sitter’s thoughts or the stories around the work—that captivates viewers for hundreds of years after their creation."

The plate is then inked and printed under pressure, forcing the paper into the recessed areas and picking up the ink resulting in characteristically raised lines. Intaglio techniques include [etching, engraving](/gene/etching-slash-engraving), aquatint, photogravure, mezzotint, and drypoint; oftentimes used  in combination, these techniques can produce variations in both tone and contrast, as seen in this [intaglio print](/artwork/francisco-de-goya-figures-dancing-in-a-circle-from-los-disparates) by Francisco Goya.

Greek and Roman marble sculptures, though often thought of as pristine white, were in fact brightly painted. Throughout the history of Islamic art, intricate, ornamental tilework and mosaics often boasted bright color schemes as well. Bright colors—saturated hues with a high level of lightness—evoke strong associations and meanings throughout the world, denote deities, emotions, or ideas. However, with the rise of Neo-Classicism in the West, which embraced the dictates of purity and “good taste,” bright colors were deemed too garish and fell out of fashion. With the advent of abstraction in the 20th century, however, artists once again widely explored bright colors, oftentimes as a means of expressing psychological experiences. Before the advent of synthetic pigments in the early 18th century, bright colors were difficult and costly to achieve, but since the mass-manufacturing of bold pigments and dyes beginning in the mid-20th century, bright colors are widely available.

In the West in the 20th century various reasons accounted for painters’ use of this simplified palette. For example, Kazimir Malevich’s [_Black Square_](/artwork/kasimir-severinovich-malevich-black-square) was one of the first expressions of the artist’s [Suprematist](/gene/suprematism) theories. Additionally, [Robert Rauschenberg](/artist/robert-rauschenberg) made his modular panel “[White Paintings](/artwork/robert-rauschenberg-white-painting-seven-panel)” in 1951 with the aim of creating something that did not look as if it were done by hand. In doing so, he paved the way for later [Minimalist art](/gene/minimalism).

Artists' interest in the aesthetic and symbolic qualities of decaying and decomposing matter has persisted throughout the history of art. Images of ruins—as symbols of natural devastation, the transience of the built environment, and human mortality—first emerged in [Renaissance](/gene/renaissance) paintings, in which landscapes were often littered with the remnants of Greco-Roman statues and the wounded bodies of martyred Saints draped across classical columns. Representations of deterioration and decay continued through the Romantic period, exemplified by [Hubert Robert](/artist/hubert-robert)’s etchings of statuary fragments, and into the 20th century; [Nicholas Nixon](/artist/nicholas-nixon)’s portraits of AIDs victims in the 1980s captured with grotesque realism the physical deterioration of the human body, while [Aaron Siskind](/artist/aaron-siskind)’s close-up images of weathered and rusted wall reliefs and filmmaker [Tacita Dean](/artist/tacita-dean)’s extended shots of fading carpets and rotting fruits explore a fascination with the material qualities of decay. Photographers [Michael Eastman](/artist/michael-eastman), [Robert Polidori](/artist/robert-polidori), and [Jin Jiangbo](/artist/jin-jiangbo) depict contemporary ruins, capturing former industrial spaces or decadent public and private interiors, now worn by years of disuse and neglect."

In the 1990s the British artist [Rachel Whiteread](/artist/rachel-whiteread) began to cast the interiors of old houses earmarked for demolition, drawing attention to issues of urban demographics and city planning. [Christo and Jeanne-Claude](/artist/christo-and-jeanne-claude) explored the intersection of architecture and politics in 1995 when they wrapped the entire German Reichstag, in Berlin, in a silvery fabric, at once obscuring and accentuating the political headquarters in a country that has shied away from overt national symbols since the Second World War. Michel Foucault, in his influential study of the Panopticon—a prison structure in which inmates existed under constant surveillance without knowing when they were being observed—proposed the idea that architecture can serve as a regulatory force, impacting human behavior the way law and social norms do.

Perhaps the most canonical representation of childhood in Western art is that of the Christ child with the Madonna, which appeared widely, beginning in the early [Renaissance](http://artsy.net/gene/renaissance) period. [Diego Velázquez](http://artsy.net/artist/diego-velazquez) often included children in his portraits of the Spanish royal family, and beginning with [Impressionism](http://artsy.net/gene/impressionism), childhood became a central theme in more intimate depictions of everyday life, ranging from [Edgar Degas](http://artsy.net/artist/edgar-degas)' dancers and [Berthe Morisot](http://artsy.net/artist/berthe-morisot)'s portraits to [Mary Cassat](http://artsy.net/artist/mary-cassatt)'s mother-and-child scenes. [Jacob A. Riis](http://artsy.net/artist/jacob-a-riis) often depicted children in his photographs of life in New York City tenements, in order to stir public empathy around their living conditions. In contemporary art, portraits of children figure in [Taryn Simon](http://artsy.net/artist/taryn-simon)'s broad genealogical projects and [Sally Mann](http://artsy.net/artist/sally-mann)'s controversial photographs of her own offspring, while artists such as [Mike Kelley](http://artsy.net/artist/mike-kelley) and [Paul McCarthy](http://artsy.net/artist/paul-mccarthy) have probed the darker elements of childhood.

The 19th century French artist [Honoré Daumier](/artist/honore-daumier), dubbed the “Michelangelo of caricature,” is most often associated with cultural commentary in art. He satirized France’s bourgeoisie and justice system, and grotesquely caricatured government officials, which endeared him to the public, but also landed him six months in prison."

Such states may occur naturally, or may be induced by ritualistic activities or mind-altering substances. It has been hypothesized that some of the earliest art ever created by humans—such as the cave paintings in Lascaux—relate to visions induced by ritualistic dancing. In the 20th century, Sigmund Freud’s foundational text for psychoanalysis, _The Interpretation of Dreams_ (1900), sought to systematize the mysteries of dream symbolism, proving hugely influential to artists interested in the subconscious, such as the [Surrealists](/gene/surrealism). More recently, in an iconic early performance titled _Rhythm 2_ (1974), [Marina Abramović](/artist/marina-abramovic-1) ingested a mind-altering prescription drug in front of an audience as an attempt to explore the relationship between the mind and the body."

In Paleolithic art, for example, figurines with stylized exaggerations of human anatomy conveyed allegories of fertility. Many cultures throughout the ages have believed in the primal power of fertility deities; ancient Egyptians invoked Menetes during childbirth, while in Greek mythology, Gaia, or Mother Earth, is associated with female fertility. Akuba figures—striking female figures with enlarged, disk-shaped heads made by the Akuba people of Ghana—were carried by women who hoped to conceive a child. In Western art, divinity and spirituality have tended to be disassociated from scenes of childbirth and pregnancy. Recently, feminists have interrogated the social taboos around this imagery by openly portraying uncensored birth and fertility scenes in various mediums and from a woman's perspective.

Every culture has its own customs for grieving the loss of individuals, and objects used in mourning or burial practices are some of the oldest artifacts in the world. Many of the artifacts that survive from [Ancient Egypt](/gene/ancient-egypt) were used in elaborate burial customs. Perhaps the earliest known portrait in China, from approximately 160 B.C.E., is a [funeral banner](/artwork/painted-banner-tomb-of-the-marquess-of-dai-mawangdui-changsha-hunan-han-dynasty) for the noblewoman Lady Dai. In [Christian Art](/gene/christian-art-and-architecture), the iconography of the [Lamentation](/tag/lamentation)—a group of figures grieving the death of Christ—was popular from the 11th through the 19th century, and the [Pietà](/tag/pieta) (the Virgin Mary mourning a dead Christ) was a common motif from the 13th through the 17th century. Modern, largely secular works about mourning often present sites for social memorializing of public figures or groups. These often take the form of figurative sculptures of specific individuals, such as Auguste Rodin’s _[Monument to Balzac](/artwork/auguste-rodin-monument-to-honore-de-balzac)_ (1891–7), though others explore mourning through abstraction, such as [Maya Lin](/artist/maya-lin)’s Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall in Washington, D.C., which offers an immersive environment for visitors to pay tribute to the American soldiers who lost their lives in the Vietnam War.

In 1916 the linguist Ferdinand Saussure proposed that the form a language takes is arbitrary and unrelated to its meaning. A decade later, the French writer Henri Michaux explored these ideas in asemic writing—writing that resembles natural language but conveys no meaning. Since then, artists have developed personal systems of pictograms and glyphs with varying degrees of legibility and idiosyncrasy, often to explore a wide range of concepts. In the 1960s, for example, [A.R. Penck](/artist/ar-penck) drew inspiration from cybernetics, the study of systems, to derive a hieroglyphic-like system of signs, which he used to represent societal and metaphysical relationships. In the 1980s, [Gu Wenda](/artist/wenda-gu) developed a system of meaningless ideograms that resemble traditional [Chinese calligraphy](/gene/east-asian-calligraphy).

Racism, which sociologist Howard Winant defines as “that which creates or reproduces hierarchical social structures based on essentialized racial categories,” has fueled unthinkable violations of human life. Race, ethnicity and visual culture are inextricably linked, and visual art presents a rich site for artists to actively overturn racist imagery. Artists have drawn on their own racial identities to create ennobling depictions of historically marginalized individuals, such as the detailed portraits of African American individuals and families by [Charles White](/artist/charles-white). In the wake of the U.S. Civil Rights Movement and the rise of [Pop art](/gene/pop-art), [David Hammons](/artist/david-hammons) and [Betye Saar](/artist/betye-saar) blended the materials and images of racist caricatures into a darkly parodic surrealism, while [Jimmie Durham](/artist/jimmie-durham) investigated Native American stereotypes. More recently, artists like Iranian-born [Shirin Neshat](/artist/shirin-neshat), whose work engages questions of female identity in the Middle East, and British-Nigerian [Yinka Shonibare](/artist/yinka-shonibare), who employs Dutch wax–printed African fabric to critique art’s colonial histories, have explored new forms of transnational culture."

The 19th century saw the Louisiana Purchase (1803) and the First Transcontinental Railroad (1869) greatly extend the reach of American settlement, access to natural resources, and lines of commerce. Far beyond its economic implications, however, the American West was a national mythology—a site of wilderness, exploration, and lawless freedom that for many represented the path to the American dream and a belief in Manifest Destiny. While this collective history brings national pride for many, westward expansion also saw its most brutal forms in the massive displacement and killing of Native Americans. Since the early 19th century artists have documented the exploration of frontier lands, as in [Carleton Emmons Watkins](/artist/carleton-emmons-watkins)’ iconic views of Yosemite National Park or [William Henry Jackson](/artist/william-henry-jackson)’s framing of the transcontinental railroad tunneling through mountains. Others, like [Frederic Remington](/artist/frederic-remington), romanticized its inhabitants through loose renderings of horsemen, cavalrymen, Native Americans, or [cowboys](/tag/cowboy)—from Andy Warhol’s depiction of [John Wayne](/artwork/andy-warhol-john-wayne) to [Richard Prince](/artist/richard-prince)’s appropriation of the iconic cowboy from Marlboro cigarette advertisements."

Iconic [Land Art](/gene/land-art) projects by [Robert Smithson](/artist/robert-smithson) and [Christo and Jean-Claude](/artist/christo-and-jeanne-claude) were both celebrated for creating new spaces and audiences for art, and critiqued for the damage they often inflicted on their environments.

In 1982, [Joseph Beuys](/artist/joseph-beuys) also initiated the planting of 7,000 oak trees throughout Kassel, Germany as his contribution to Documenta 7. More recent tendencies include objective depictions of environmental degradation, as seen in photography by [Edward Burtynsky](/artist/edward-burtynsky) and [Richard Misrach](/artist/richard-misrach), as well as research-driven investigations into the systems governing social and natural ecologies, as seen in the work of [Mark Dion](/artist/mark-dion)."

In the 19th century, [Eadweard Muybridge](/artist/eadweard-muybridge) depicted motion over short time intervals in early photographic experiments, while [Robin Rhode](/artist/robin-rhode), in photographs and video works, displays a similar interest.

The concept of trauma as personal struggle, however, became foundational in Greek mythology, with the trials and tribulations of a hero lying at the heart of Greek tragic drama. Medieval Christian art developed the motif known as the “Man of Sorrows”—a wounded and bloodied Christ figure, bearing a crown of thorns and a sorrowful expression—as an evocative reminder of suffering, meant to invoke devotion on the part of the viewer. In the 20th century, artists have been less concerned with the connection of pain to spiritual redemption, and more with the emotional and psychological toll exacted by violence, injury, suffering, or war. Iconic examples include [Pablo Picasso](/artist/pablo-picasso)’s  _Guernica_ and works by [Otto Dix](/artist/otto-dix). World War II and the Holocaust had a profound impact on art; [Christian Boltanski](/artist/christian-boltanski) and [Anselm Kiefer](/artist/anselm-kiefer), for example, developed different modes of representation to respond to the traumatic nature of those events.

Artists have long been associated with radical political activity; [Jacques-Louis David](/artist/jacques-louis-david)'s involvement in the French Revolution is an often-cited example. During the 20th century, the [Mexican Mural School](/gene/mexican-muralism) was associated with the country's 1910 revolution and continued its legacy through images of working class liberation. And American and European artists during and since the 1960s have created a multitude of antiwar and socially-engaged artworks. Their practices—as well as those of artists outside America and Europe—continue to inspire contemporary artists, as politically-engaged art is one of the most prominent types of work being created today."

By borrowing the iconography and lore of pop culture as the material for their artwork, artists are able to reflect the world we live in and comment on larger forces like globalization, technology, and consumerism. They also blur the distinction between high and low culture through their inclusion of common subject matter in “fine” art. In Western art history, since the mid-19th century artists have often referred to aspects of popular culture. [Gustave Courbet](/artist/gustave-courbet), for example, alluded to a popular image of the Wandering Jew in his 1854 _Meeting_. [Pablo Picasso](/artist/pablo-picasso) is generally regarded as the first artist to include an actual piece of popular culture—wallpaper printed with a chair-caning pattern—in an artwork, his [_Still Life with Chair-Caning_](/artwork/pablo-picasso-still-life-with-chair-caning) of 1912. Pop artists [Andy Warhol](/artist/andy-warhol) and [Roy Lichtenstein](/artist/roy-lichtenstein) are probably the best known for their inclusion of popular imagery, such as supermarket foods and comic book heroines, into their works."

In London and New York, vibrant, collaborative scenes emerged: Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood’s shop, Seditionaries, outfitted the Sex Pistols for their first gig in 1975. The East Village’s alternative space Colab, founded in 1977, featured punk and new wave performances and hosted artists such as [Jenny Holzer](/artist/jenny-holzer) and [Kiki Smith](/artist/kiki-smith), while street artists [Keith Haring](/artist/keith-haring) and [Jean-Michel Basquiat](/artist/jean-michel-basquiat) were involved with the scene at the Mudd Club. Punk quickly became a benchmark for authenticity and the ultimate in cool, making it a target for appropriation by precisely those forces—high culture, consumerism, authority—it sought to resist. Some have traced its attitude and focus on destruction to the [Dada](/gene/dada) movement of the early 20th century, understanding it as a type of anti-art disdaining visual and cultural norms as gatekeepers to participation. Many of punk’s founders came from working class backgrounds, and some explicitly aligned punk with this group’s political interests, an alliance that posed a particular challenge to punk’s relationship to fine art, traditionally the realm of high culture.

In Classical sculpture, scenes of death ranged from highly dramatic mythological scenes to the deeply introspective last moments of mortal subjects. On a more intimate scale, the pietà (Mary mourning of the body of Christ) became a commonly painted and sculpted subject beginning in the 13th century in Northern Europe; it soon spread to the south, and continued to appear regularly into the 17th century. The vanitas image, a reflection on the transitory nature of human existence that includes memento mori like skulls or hourglasses, was popularized in 17th-century Netherlands. From the 18th to the 19th centuries, French painting saw a shift from the admiring scenes of mortal struggle by [Romantics](/gene/romanticism) to sedate scenes by Realists, such as Gustave Courbet’s [_Burial at Ornans_](/artwork/gustave-courbet-the-burial-at-ornans). In 20th century Western art, reflections on mortality range from scenes of brutal atrocity (e.g. [Pablo Picasso](/artist/pablo-picasso)’s _Guernica_) to the self-destructing machines of [Jean Tinguely](/artist/jean-tinguely), to homages to the victims of AIDS (by [Nan Goldin](/artist/nan-goldin) and [Felix Gonzalez-Torres](/artist/felix-gonzalez-torres), amongst others).

In the 20th century, with the rise of industrial manufacturing, the term has become more generally associated with mass commodities or cheap entertainment, considered decorative or evocative of lowbrow taste. Kitsch suffered its most serious intellectual blow in art circles when Clement Greenberg railed against it in a famous 1939 essay, in which he claimed it anathema to progressive, avant-garde art since it pandered to the masses. The rise of consumerism in the United States and Europe in the 1950s and '60s generated an artistic interest in popular culture, however, often with an eye towards dismantling the divide between ostensibly “fine art” and mass appeal; nowhere was this more notable than with the rise of [Pop Art](/gene/pop-art) in the United States. Today, the idea that something can be “so bad it’s good” is so common that the term “kitsch” no longer retains the negative associations it once did, and artists today often create works that embrace bad taste and question the high- and lowbrow division in art. Importantly, while kitsch is generally associated with European or American culture, it has parallels throughout the world. For example, the concept of kawaii—or cuteness—in Japanese culture is a quality opposed to the aesthetic ideal of refinement and plays a prominent role in popular culture and entertainment.

Before the advent of Modernism, narrative was a major aspect of Western Art, in particular due to the influence and prestige of history paintings, which presented sweeping stories from history or myth. During the 20th century, as Western art generally tended towards abstraction, stories (and to a greater extent, any subject matter) were de-emphasized in favor of formal characteristics. In recent years however, artists have reintroduced (and reinvented) narrative, cobbling together, overlapping, or remixing threads from fictional and nonfictional sources, and personal and collective histories."

[Botticelli](/artist/alessandro-filipepi-called-sandro-botticelli) further advanced the idea of divine love, as seen in his [_Birth of Venus_](/artwork/alessandro-filipepi-called-sandro-botticelli-the-birth-of-venus). Modern and contemporary works have continued to reveal love in all of its faces, including the anxious confessions of [Tracey Emin](/artist/tracey-emin) and the fraught and tragic circumstances of lovers during the AIDS crisis, as depicted by [Nan Goldin](/artist/nan-goldin). At times the social conventions surrounding love are examined or parodied, as they are in William Hogarth's ""Marriage à la Mode"" series. At other times, art touches on the simplest symbols of love ([Jim Dine](/artist/jim-dine)'s hearts, for instance) or the word itself, as in [Robert Indiana](/artist/robert-indiana)'s iconic sculptures.

This proved to be an effective medium for widely distributing political caricatures as well as scenes of everyday life. In the 20th century, artists turned to addressing the form and content of messages distributed by mass media, particularly television. For instance, [Nam June Paik](/artist/nam-june-paik-and-jud-yalkut)'s early experimentations in video art frequently involved the appropriation and distortion of television footage, while [Andy Warhol](/artist/andy-warhol)'s repetitive silkscreens of such images blurred the lines between critical and celebratory. Brazilian artist [Hélio Oiticica](/artist/helio-oiticica) included television screens in his “Tropicalia” installations, joining an international group of artists in the 1960s interested in subverting mass media strategies for different ends.

In the 20th century artists like [Marcel Duchamp](artist/marcel-duchamp] and [Robert Rauschenberg](Robert-rauschenberg) continued to defy established notions of what constitutes “art” by deeming everyday objects suitable for inclusion in sculptures, or as art objects themselves.

With roots in classical philosophy—Plato’s allegory of the cave is the most famous example—this artistic tradition is almost exclusively western, drawing on, but distinct from, [symbolism](/gene/symbolic-composition). Allegories must characteristically be deciphered by viewers and are often intelligible only to those familiar with the cultural context of the work. Though artistic allegories fell out of favor in the 19th century, when it was believed they would hinder direct communication, some contemporary artists, such as [Walton Ford](/artist/walton-ford) and [Kara Walker](/artist/kara-walker), have revived the device, addressing the ambiguities that can arise when viewers interpret visual meanings.

Such schema include the four elements of the Western tradition (earth, fire, wind, water) and the Chinese Taoist concept of “Wŭ Xíng,” which explains both natural and aesthetic phenomena as being based on the elements of wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. Modern science has defined the chemical properties of elements as a pure chemical substance consisting of a single type of atom, such as gold, iron, hydrogen, or mercury. Artworks in this category may take a single element or entire systems as their subject matter and may explore various natural or synthetic processes related to them, such as the pseudoscience of alchemy or chemical reactions like oxidation, combustion, or precipitation. For example, [Hans Haacke](/artist/hans-haacke)’s _Condensation Cube_ (1965), a hermetically sealed Plexiglas cube filled with water that evaporates and eventually condenses as it is heated by light, uses [Minimalist](/gene/minimalism) forms to explore both biological and chemical processes.

As this brutal chapter in world history has had long-reaching social consequences, artists who take the African Diaspora as their subject matter may also deal with the development of post-colonial African nations, or, more broadly, the transnational quality of Black culture at large in the modern world. Often informed by Pan-Africanism, or the solidarity of African peoples worldwide, aesthetic approaches to the African Diaspora may critique the economies of the transatlantic slave trade, histories of colonialism and its legacies, as well as celebrate the cultural and artistic accomplishments of people of African descent (directly countering the alignment of African art with Primitivism, a trend amongst European modern artists like [Pablo Picasso](/artist/pablo-picasso) and the German Expressionist group [Die Brücke](/gene/die-brucke)). Today, the Kenyan artist [Wangechi Mutu](/artist/wangechi-mutu) explores themes related to African women and diaspora, while the British artist [Chris Ofili](/artist/chris-ofili), born to Nigerian parents, incorporates European and Nigerian aesthetics into his interrogation of race."

In the 1980s, its application to cultural production was advanced in fields of critical race theory and ethnic and feminist studies by scholars Evelyn Nakano Glenn and Patricia Hill Collins. Artists who take intersectionality as their focus are interested in the way that different types of discrimination—such as racism, classism, xenophobia, misogyny, or ageism—can converge and impact individuals and groups, and their work explores these complex interactions. In her photographic portraits of LGBT youth, South African photographer [Zanele Muholi](/artist/zanele-muholi) creates positive images of black queer identity.

These artists sought to expose the ideologies and power structures underlying the circulation, display, and discussion of art. In his seminal 1972 work _the eagle from the Oligocene to the present_, for example, Broodthaers brought together 266 found objects and displayed a wall text alongside each one that read “This is not a work of art,” thus questioning museums’ role in exhibiting and conferring status to artworks, as well as the role of the artist as the maker of original artworks.

In recent years, large numbers of migrant workers from South and Central America and the Caribbean have traveled to the United States, while the Mediterranean Sea has seen thousands of migrants traveling from northern Africa to Europe. Many contemporary artists address the global scope of migration and its personal and political consequences: the French collective Claire Fontaine has installed a neon sign reading “Foreigners Everywhere” in various translations in numerous locations worldwide, drawing attention to the universal concern with immigration. [Alfredo Jaar](/artist/alfredo-jaar)’s One Million Finnish Passports (1995) references the total number of citizenship applications rejected by Finland, bringing attention to the impact of stringent citizenship policies in the EU. Other important examples of migration in art include [Titian](/artist/titian)’s strikingly large-scale 1514 woodblock print, [The Submersion of the Pharaoh’s Army in the Red Sea](/artwork/titian-the-submersion-of-pharaohs-army-in-the-red-sea), which represents a key scene in the escape of the Israelites from Egypt in the Old Testament. [Jacob Lawrence](/artist/jacob-lawrence)’s 60-panel narrative painting series, “The Migration of the Negro” (1940–41), documents the Great Migration, in which 6 million African Americans relocated to Northern cities from the rural South between 1910 and 1970.

It was followed by books by H.G. Wells and Jules Verne, and in the 20th century, expanded from literature into myriad creative forms, from illustration to film and animation. Early 20th-century illustrations for science fiction magazines, such as _Amazing Stories_, depicted visions of [utopian](/gene/utopia) technological advances, while artists during the 1960s and 1970s employed science fictional tropes to respond to both the promises and anxieties of accelerating technological and scientific advancements like [space exploration](/gene/outer-space), [surveillance](/gene/surveillance), and nuclear power. Works characterized as science fiction often explore alternative and future scenarios based on developments in [science](/gene/science), [technology](/gene/art-and-technology), society, and [nature](/gene/nature), creatively visualizing the most extreme long-term consequences of present-day reality. For example, [Robert Smithson](/artist/robert-smithson), along with artists associated with the [Land Art](/gene/land-art) movement, created performances and sculptures that combined notions of time travel and the primordial world.

Since the 18th century, such techniques have historically been associated with art academies, the most famous of which is the French Académie des Beaux-Arts. The French Académie importantly established a set of acceptable genres in which artists could paint, namely history painting, portraiture, still-life, and landscape. With the rise of abstract art in the 20th century, realist painting ceased to be the dominant mode of art-making, being viewed as less progressive, or even retrograde.

In the early 20th century, artists like [Paul Klee](/artist/paul-klee) attempted to reform art's staid conventions of beauty by returning to supposed primal or elementary beginnings. The art of children or those with mental disorders, which Klee championed and mimicked in his own work, seemed to offer access to authentic experience, unaffected by the trappings of civilization. Since then, many artists have attempted to present ostensibly unmediated expressions of creativity by eschewing traditional painting technique, a strategy that can be called “faux naïf”, derived from the French for “falsely naïve”.

Attempts at objective portraiture—the honest, real, unmediated portrayal of a person—have a long history in photography. In a series of sober portraits from the 1920s, German photographer [August Sander](/artist/august-sander) systematically documented his countrymen; the uniform staging and composition of these works accentuated social and professional markings, turning his subjects into social types. This series revealed a tension between a photograph’s ability to reveal something of a sitter’s individuality and inner life, and its exact representation of outward appearance. In recent practice, many photographers have also tried to present their subjects as they really are, flaws and all, while allowing for moments of candidness and vulnerability. Less austere (and more deliberate) than a mug shot, these works often bring facial features into high relief, allowing expressiveness to recede and making the sitter seem somehow up-close and removed at the same time. As Alfred Döblin said in 1928, “These photographs, like a fingerprint, are only one fact by which to identify a certain person.”"

Recent scholarship on Minimalism, however, has argued for its embeddedness in the politics of its day: the use of industrial materials, such as steel and Plexiglas, spoke to American military-industrial prowess, while repeated modular elements conjured a consumer society of replication.

While nature themes—plants, animals, or spirits—have been central to art since pre-history, the landscape genre, which favors sweeping topographical surveys over mere individual natural elements, emerged in ancient Greece in scenic theater backdrops and domestic frescoes. After the fall of the Roman Empire, landscape motifs were largely absent from European art until the 14th century, but they flourished in Asia, particularly in the mist-shrouded mountains and visions of untamed nature of Song Dynasty (10th-13th century China) ink paintings. In European art since the [Renaissance](/gene/renaissance), artists and theorists have debated whether landscapes should depict “real” or “ideal” views of the natural world. An example of the latter is [Annibale Carracci](/artist/annibale-carracci)’s _Flight into Egypt_ (1604), in which tranquil skies and neatly tailored hills make for an impossible idyll, as if ordered by divine law.

Food has long been a favored subject of artists, and at times even a medium for making art. In Western Art, depictions of food date back to funerary paintings of food offerings in ancient Egypt. The Classical historian Pliny claimed that Greek painter Zeuxis once painted grapes so realistic that birds came to pick at them. Depictions continued in [Roman art](/gene/roman-art), where the putto (male infant) depicted with grape vines was a common motif. In [Baroque](/gene/baroque) painting, food appeared regularly as a still-life element, as exemplified by [Carravaggio](/artist/michelangelo-merisi-da-caravaggio)'s _Bacchus_ or the _bodegones_ (meaning 'pantry still-lives') of Spanish painters [Diego Velázquez](/artist/diego-velazquez) and [Francisco de Zurbarán](/artist/francisco-de-zurbaran). [Paul Cézanne](/artist/paul-cezanne)'s fruit still lifes presented new forms of representing three-dimensional space. In the 20th century, food was central to [Pop Art](/gene/pop-art)'s explorations of consumerism, as in [Andy Warhol](/artist/andy-warhol)'s Campell's soup cans, [Claes Oldenburg](/artist/claes-oldenburg)'s monumental hamburger and ice cream cone sculptures, and [Wayne Thiebaud](/artist/wayne-thiebaud)'s paintings of cakes and pastries.

Such ideas were applied to art beginning in the 15th century. For example, [Leon Battista Alberti](/artist/leon-battista-alberti)'s architectural designs made explicit reference to musical harmony and employed ratios that he thought would produce consonances. This type of practice became widespread in Renaissance architecture and soon found a place in investigations of linear perspective in drawing and painting, such as in the work of [Leonardo da Vinci](/artist/leonardo-da-vinci). Music was essential to early forays into abstraction at the beginning of the 20th century, as it served as an ideal starting point for emotive, non-representational compositions such as those of [Wassily Kandinsky](/artist/wassily-kandinsky), [Paul Klee](/artist/paul-klee), and [Francis Picabia](/artist/francis-picabia), all of whom were part of artistic and intellectual communities that included musicians.

Caricatures exaggerate features of individuals for the purpose of humor, mockery or criticism. Related to caricature, parody is a narrative or literary device—as opposed to a type of visual depiction—that imitates an original work or set of conventions while distorting it to comic, satirical or critical effect. In Western art, parody can be traced back to ancient Greek drama, while caricature is generally considered to have emerged out of 16th-century carnivalesque culture and grotesque disfigurations of the human figure. Over the course of the late-18th and 19th centuries in Europe and the United States, caricatures circulated in the press and pamphlets often delivered pointed political or social commentary. [William Hogarth](/artist/william-hogarth), considered the father of English caricature, made light of English social mores in his paintings and prints of the late 1700s, and by the 1830s in France a publication devoted entirely to the form, _La Caricature_, provided a forum for [Honoré Daumier](/artist/honore-daumier)’s political drawings.

Mythological narratives were represented widely in Greek and Roman art, particularly in pottery, sculpture, and mosaics. The allegorical power of the widely known stories remained long after the decline of associated pagan religions, and overlaps between pagan and Christian imagery are visible in the tombs of the earliest Christians. While classical imagery was largely dormant in the Medieval period, it returned in full force in iconic Renaissance paintings and sculptures by the likes of [Botticelli](/artist/alessandro-filipepi-called-sandro-botticelli), [Titian](/artist/tiziano-vecellio-called-titian), and [Raphael](/artist/raphael-raffaello-sanzio-da-urbino) in Italy and [Albrecht Dürer](/artist/albrecht-durer) in Germany, all of whom sought to reconcile Christian piety with Classical thought.

While in subsequent years, with the more expressive tendencies of [Romanticism](/gene/romanticism) and [Impressionism](/gene/impressionism), preparatory stages were omitted in favor of direct application of paint on the canvas, the medium endured.

Perhaps the most iconic example of man's negotiation with the power of nature, [Caspar David Friedrich](/artist/caspar-david-friedrich)’s _Monk by the Sea_, embodied the spirit of the 19th-century [Romantics](/gene/romanticism), who valued the individual’s subjective contemplation of nature as part of a personal, poetic experience.

An important and highly recurring subject matter in the history of art, featuring a likeness or representation of the artist by the artist. As mirrors became cheaper and clearer in the 15th century, the [Early Renaissance](/gene/early-renaissance) saw the proliferation of self-portraiture as a genre in itself, owing perhaps also to an increasing interest in humanism and the individual. The term ""self-portrait"" may refer to just a portrait of the artist, or a portrait of an artist located within a larger scene, group, or composition, also called an ""inserted"" self-portrait—as in Diego Velazquez’s [_Las Meninas_](/artwork/diego-velazquez-las-meninas-the-maids-of-honour) (1656).

In the 19th century, self-reflection in art took hold much more extensively, with artists using the technique to comment upon their social status, or for the purposes of psychological introspection as in the works of [Vincent van Gogh](/artist/vincent-van-gogh), Frida Kahlo, or [Egon Schiele](/artist/egon-schiele).

Individual portraiture—the likeness of a single person—has long been one of the most popular forms of art. Whether as an attempt at objective or documentary truth or to express the power and prestige (or idea) of a person, individual portraits examine what it means to be human and an individual. Classical Greek portraiture was concerned with formal, ideal beauty rather than documentary truth. The Renaissance and a renewed interest in humanism established the great portrait tradition, which would pervade Europe for the next three hundred years, dominated by [Raphael](/artist/raphael) in Rome and [Titian](/artist/titian) in Venice. Individual portraits were also often commissioned by monarchs to reinforce and display royal might: [Hans Holbein](/artist/hans-holbein-the-younger)’s famous portrait of Henry VIII is a quintessential example of the portrait’s power to flatter and play to a sitter’s vanity. Likewise, portraits played a vital role in displaying and mirroring the material wealth of the growing merchant class in the Dutch golden age, as in the work of [Frans Hals](/artist/frans-hals) or [Rembrandt van Rijn](/artist/rembrandt-van-rijn). The invention of photography in the mid 1800s caused the portrait tradition to rapidly change; the newfound ability to capture an individual “as they were” meant that the painted portrait could no longer be taken for granted. Many variations in the photographic portrait resulted as did the exploration of how abstract painting might still make a portrait. Artists continue today to reconcile the traditional means of portraiture with photography."

52163bc78b3b81da7f000229,http://artsy.net/gene/reinforced-concrete-construction,Reinforced Concrete Construction,Design Attributes & Concepts,"Although concrete has been prized for millennia in architecture for its weight-bearing strength, the addition of steel reinforcing bars (“rebar”) to improve the material’s tensility was first developed during the mid-19th century in France. Since concrete can be poured and metal can be bent into any shape, many architects have taken advantage of this versatile and cost-effective material to construct complex structures. Beginning in the early 20th century, the Belgian architect Auguste Perret (with the help of his brothers, Gustave and Claude) built the world’s first reinforced concrete apartment block at 25 rue Franklin, in Paris. The unparalleled strength of reinforced concrete meant that fewer structural supports were needed, which allowed Perret to use large windows on the facade to let in more light and to create more open space on each floor. Many iconic buildings of the 20th and 21st centuries have since been built using reinforced concrete construction, including [Frank Lloyd Wright](/artist/frank-lloyd/wright)’s Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, in New York; [Le Corbusier](/artist/le-corbusier)’s Villa Savoye, in Paris; and the Burj Khalifa (currently the world’s tallest building), in Dubai.

While such objects date from antiquity and appear in various world cultures, they are commonly associated with European customs of religious devotion and later, the consumption habits of aristocrats and nobles. The former category includes crucifixes, religious figurines, rosaries, and reliquaries, while the latter includes brooches, cameos, snuff boxes, statuettes, and watch pieces. Materials varied locally and over time, but enamel, gemstone, ivory, hard-stone, and precious metals were regularly used. Objects of vertu were often adorned with royal or aristocratic portraits, scenes from iconic paintings, historical events, flora or purely decorative forms. Perhaps the most prized examples today are the resplendent series of easter eggs made by the Russian [House of Fabergé](/artist/house-of-faberge) for Tsars Alexander III and Nicholas II in the late 19th and early 20th centuries."

While the earliest tapestries date to 11th-century Germany, in several European centers the commercial production of tapestries for nobility began in the 14th century and expanded thereafter. Among the most iconic works produced during this period are the seven tapestries of [_The Hunt of the Unicorn_](/artwork/the-unicorn-at-bay-from-the-hunt-of-the-unicorn-tapestries), which are made of wool, silk, and metallic thread and follow a detailed, symbol-laden narrative. With changing tastes and attitudes in Europe, commercial tapestry production substantially decreased in the 19th century. Interest in tapestry was renewed in the late 19th century by the [Arts and Crafts movement](/gene/arts-and-crafts-movement) in England and the Wiener Werkstätte in Germany, which advocated preindustrial craftsmanship. In the 20th century, artist [Anni Albers](/artist/anni-albers) was a proponent of tapestry weaving at the [Bauhaus](/gene/bauhaus) and at [Black Mountain College](/gene/black-mountain-college), while present-day artists such as [Sheila Hicks](/artist/sheila-hicks) continue in this tradition.

While the use of natural light has always been an aspect of architectural practice, for thousands of years buildings considered the effects and uses of early forms of artificial lighting, such as candles, rushlights, and oil lamps. Developments in lighting saw rapid changes during the Industrial Revolution. Gas street lamps arrived in London in 1815; the electric arc lamp, made from two carbon electrodes, was developed in the early 19th century and first used at the Paris Opéra in 1844; and the Englishman Joseph Swan and American Thomas Edison developed the first incandescent electric lamps in 1878 and 1879, hugely increasing access to electrical lighting. Iconic lamp designs, such as those by [Tiffany Studios](/artist/tiffany-studios) and [Isamu Noguchi](/artist/isamu-noguchi), have become iconic, historical works. In the mid-20th century, fluorescent lighting was widely installed in offices and schools.

In cities such as Tikal, Chichén Itzá, and Tulum (each of which was prominent at a different time), the Mayan people developed architectural forms, such as the pyramid temple and the palace, that employed [masonry construction](/gene/masonry-construction) and were at times adorned with [mosaics](/gene/mosaics). Other developments in Mayan culture included a shared calendar system, the mythological narratives and iconography of the Popol Vuh text, and various instruments used for personal and communal religious functions. The last major Mayan confederacy collapsed as a result of infighting around 1450. Because centralization in Mayan territories was absent, the Spanish conquest of the Yucatán Peninsula was met with over two decades of local resistance before colonial control was solidified in 1546. Nevertheless, pockets of Guatemala remained under Mayan control throughout the 17th century, and Mayan language and customs persist in the region today."

Though incredibly diverse across regions and time periods, there are two generally recognized types of Aboriginal art: figurative and geometric (though these two styles can often be combined). These works in certain contexts carry understood meanings—geometric designs, for example, are variously believed to have been imparted by ancestors. The artist plays a significant role in traditional Aboriginal society, as artworks are seen as sacred forms of religious knowledge. What is widely understood as Contemporary Aboriginal Art has its roots in an art teacher named Geoffrey Bardon, who in 1971 gave art materials to a group of Aboriginal men in Papunya; when it sparked their interest, he worked with 11 men to form a cooperative, the Papunya Tula Artists, which has since grown to include 60 artists nationwide. Known for its complex abstractions of dots and lines in earth tones, Contemporary Aboriginal is arguably the most significant strand of Australian art today."

Ceramics are made by shaping water, earthen powders, and clay into forms, which are then fired at high temperatures. Around the globe, the earliest examples were developed purely out of the need for hand-formed tools and ceremonial objects; some of the earliest surviving ceramics include the [_Venus of Willendorf_](/artwork/venus-of-willendorf) (24,000 B.C.) and the Qin Dynasty’s Terracota Army (210 B.C.). Since, ceramics have evolved into an increasingly complex, versatile art form. Interrogating the boundaries of sculpture, form, and function, ceramics encompass a myriad of techniques and styles, such as Japanese raku, wheel-throwing, slab construction, and hand-forming, as well as various clay types including terracotta, stoneware, and porcelain. Having bridged the art-craft divide, present-day ceramic artists like [Katsuyo Aoki](/artist/katsuyo-aoki), [Shio Kusaka](/artist/shio-kusaka), and [Rachel Kneebone](/artist/rachel-kneebone) are evolving the traditional techniques of ceramics practiced by pioneers like Paul Daschel, Edmond Lacenal, and [Galileo Chini](/artist/galileo-chini) to produce increasingly innovative and experimental contemporary ceramic works."

In the 1st century CE a new type of architecture took advantage of refinements in the use of the material, as in [the Pantheon](/artwork/apollodorus-of-damascus-the-pantheon) in Rome, constructed of a large dome atop a massive concrete cylinder. Strong, cheaper than traditional stone, and easily transportable, concrete is made by combining water with an aggregate (such as small pieces of stones or brick) and a binder (such as lime or cement) and then allowing the malleable mass to harden; it is often reinforced with steel bars (rebar) to increase its tensile strength. Underutilized for centuries after the classical period, it became a mainstay of modern architecture and infrastructure. It has been used to construct both masterpieces of aesthetic innovation, such as Le Corbusier’s [_Notre Dame du Haut_](/artwork/le-corbusier-chapelle-de-notre-dame-du-haut-ronchamp-france), and the massive housing blocks and anonymous, utilitarian structures that fueled 20th-century urbanization. Artists have since employed the material to exploit both its physical properties and its complex modernist legacy. British sculptor [Rachel Whiteread](/artist/rachel-whiteread) creates concrete casts of the interiors of buildings slated for demolition, giving form to empty urban spaces."

Glass—a hard, transparent material based in silica—is occasionally found in nature, but most often man-made. Since the invention of the glass-blowing process in first-century Syria, a wide array of techniques and uses for the malleable material have been developed around the world. Notable historical examples include Byzantine mosaics, Medieval stained glass, and [Art Nouveau](/gene/art-nouveau) glass in the late-19th century. Modern and contemporary artists have used glass to various optical and conceptual ends; [Marcel Duchamp](/artist/marcel-duchamp), [Robert Smithson](/artist/robert-smithson), and [Larry Bell](/artist/larry-bell), for instance, continued to explore the potential of the material, while glass has been integral to pioneering works by architects and engineers since the industrial revolution.

It is not clear exactly when encaustic (from the Greek enkaustikos, “to burn in”) was first used, but some of the earliest surviving examples date from as far back as the 1st century BC. Originally referring to a specific process of using heat to fuse beeswax with pigment and resin, encaustic has become a more general term for the use of wax and painting in tandem. Because of its durability, encaustic was most likely first used by the Greeks in order to waterproof and decorate ships, but eventually found its way into more traditional forms of art. After the fall of the Byzantine empire, where the medium appears in many religious icons, encaustic largely disappeared until the 18th century when it was used by artists trying to imitate Greek and Roman Art. In the 20th century, encaustic is most often associated with the work of [Jasper Johns](/artist/jasper-johns), who used it in his Flag paintings, the first of which was displayed in 1955.

Humans have produced clothing for as far back as archeologists can trace, but the modern fashion industry, with its labels, magazines, and the imperative of style, emerged in the late 18th century, primarily as haute couture (“high fashion”). In the 20th century, enabled by the rise of consumer culture and technologies of mass production like the sewing machine, factory-made prêt-à-porter (“ready to wear”) brought fashion into everyday life.

In the 1920s, photographers flaunted the many techniques that lent the camera its unique capacity to capture the modern world. One such technique was particularly striking, turning the world on its head, sometimes literally: the extreme angle. Taken upside-down, from the ground up (what Rodchenko, himself a pioneer of experimental photography, called a ""worm's eye view""), from the sky (aerial views or ""bird's eye views""), tilted (sometimes called the ""Batman angle""), or rotated, photographs can enable us to see the world anew. Such techniques have also been employed—both before and after the advent of photography—by painters, in particular contemporary artists who use photographic source material to show aspects of everyday life from unexpected viewpoints. [Jenny Saville](/artist/jenny-saville), for example, depicts the female figure up-close and from beneath, disorienting the viewer, while [Marilyn Minter](/artist/marilyn-minter) zooms in on individual body parts and accessories from a tilted angle, producing glamorous, off-kilter images with photorealistic precision."

The term “all-over picture” was coined by Greenberg in his 1948 essay “The Crisis of the Easel Picture.” Tracing the origins of the phenomenon to the consistency of light, color, and gesture in [Monet](/artist/claude-monet)’s Impressionist paintings and [Picasso](/artist/pablo-picasso)’s [Cubist](/gene/cubism) paintings, Greenberg hailed the arrival in the work of New York's mid-century avant-garde of what he called “polyphonic,” “decentralized,” and “uniform” compositions similar to those of repeated wallpaper decorations. The term was first used to refer to the gestural compositions of [Jackson Pollock](/artist/jackson-pollock) and [Mark Tobey](/artist/mark-tobey), and later for the color fields of [Barnett Newman](/artist/barnett-newman) and [Ad Reinhardt](/artist/ad-reinhardt). Abandoning the traditional elements of easel painting, such as focal point and pictorial hierarchies, what are now often referred to as allover compositions extend indefinitely to all four edges of the canvas and treat the entirety of the surface evenly. Many of conceptual artist [Sol Lewitt](/artist/sol-lewitt)'s iconic “wall drawings” bring a larger scale and a scientific precision to allover abstraction. Contemporary artists such as [Mark Bradford](/artist/mark-bradford) and [Dan Colen](/artist/dan-colen) use new mediums and techniques to create allover compositions, demonstrating the continued prevalence of the tendency."

The extent to which each of these forms is related, as well as the history of the term “arabesque,” is hotly debated among art historians. Arabesque has a specific meaning in [Islamic art](/gene/islamic-art-and-architecture), where it refers to the vegetal patterned surface decorations that flourished from the 10th to 15th centuries and adorned walls from Spain to Northern Africa, highly ornamented [calligraphy](/gene/arabic-slash-farsi-calligraphy), or intricate patterning on sculpture and other objects. Its meaning in other aesthetic traditions is less clear (some art historians argue that it should only be used to describe Islamic art).

Incredibly prolific, Picasso adapted his aesthetic over time. His most characteristic style, however, and the one most often adopted by others, is [Cubism](/gene/cubism), a technique that depicts people or objects by breaking them into various planes. Picasso later drew on these principles while employing bright colors and curvilinear forms, flattening his figures to create striking portraits with seemingly distorted facial features. It is nearly impossible to catalogue the myriad ways that artists have created stylistically similar works: in the 1910s, artists like [Albert Gleizes](/artist/albert-gleizes) and [Jean Metzinger](/artist/jean-metzinger) adapted Picasso’s mature Cubist style.

The New York Photo League, founded in 1936 by a group of socially conscious photographers, chronicled the gritty realities of urban life, and in so doing exposed both the vibrancy and diversity of the city and the plight and suffering of ordinary people. Such work rejected the cool formalism of modern photography, and increasingly in the 1960s—through the work of [Garry Winogrand](/artist/garry-winogrand) and [Lee Friedlander](/artist/lee-friedlander)—became associated with the snapshot aesthetic.

However, this is a relatively recent development; although early experiments with various photosensitive chemicals began in the 1840s shortly after photography’s birth, it was not until the 1890s that such chemical processes were successfully applied to the production of color film, and only a few early experimenters—mostly amateur scientists or intrepid travelers—used the medium to capture nature, cultural sites, or the occasional sitter. And it wasn't until Kodak’s breakthroughs in the mass manufacture of color film in 1935 that color photography became widely accessible, and commercial photographers swiftly adopted the new “Kodachrome” brand. In art, the delay took even longer; the watershed moment was [William Eggleston](/artist/william-eggleston)’s exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art in 1976—the first major museum exhibition of color photography.

Woodcut is the oldest printmaking technique, originating in China and reaching the West in the 13th century; the linocut was invented in the late 19th century. The bold mark of a woodcut and the (often apparent) wood grain impression contrasts the more fluid mark of the linocut. During the 15th century, German artist [Albrecht Dürer](artist/albrecht-durer) mastered the technique of carving into wood, finessing the vigorous woodcut mark into articulated fine lines; centuries later, [Expressionists](gene/austrian-and-german-expressionism) like [Ernst Ludwig Kirchner](artist/ernst-ludwig-kirchner) and [Emil Nolde](artist/emil-nolde) would revive the German woodcut tradition, exploring the medium’s graphic potential with more aggressive marks and flat planes of color.

Though they produce visually similar results, etching involves incising a wax-coated metal plate with a sharp tool and placing the plate into an acid bath. The acid corrodes the exposed lines, leaving the waxy ground unaffected; the plate is then inked and printed, forcing the paper into the incised lines. Considered one of the great masters of the technique, [Rembrandt van Rijn](/artist/rembrandt-van-rijn) harnessed the medium’s similarity to drawing with a pencil or pen.

The technique involves drawing directly on flat stone with an oil-based implement, then coating the stone with a water-based liquid. The applied marks repel the liquid, so that when oil-based ink is applied to the stone it fills in the image, allowing it to be transferred onto a sheet. Since the [19th century](/gene/19th-century), lithography has been widely used by commercial and fine artists as a means to mass-produce images, maps, and texts. It was explored early on by [Eugène Delacroix](/artist/eugene-victor-ferdinand-delacroix-eugene-delacroix) and [Honoré Daumier](/artist/honore-daumier), but it was artists in the latter half of the 19th century who unleashed the medium with bold experimentation.

This is partly due to the diminishing cost barriers of 3-D printing, a process in which typically plastic- or metal-based materials are deposited layer by layer. Other CAM processes include subtractive techniques, in which material is removed from a large starting block (usually of wood or metal) until the digitally designed form is achieved. The two most common types of this technique are CNC routing and milling. Both use a movable rotating cutter guided by digital instructions that cut into and carve a starting block of material.

Examples of carving can be found in ancient objects the world over, from paleolithic objects decorated with animal forms found in France to Shang dynasty oracle bones incised with ancient writing from China, and classical Greek Caryatid figures still standing today on the Acropolis. Even thousands of years ago, artists like the anonymous sculptor of a voluptuous 10th-century Yogini from India experimented with the ability of carved imagery to operate in both two and three dimensions, creating dramatic volume in contrast to flat space. To this day, carving continues to take forms both minute and monumental, from virtuosic carved sculptures to paintings incised for texture."

This technique has used been all over the world for thousands of years; some First Nations people of the Pacific Northwest made bentwood boxes by steaming and bending a single piece of wood; traditional uses of these varied from storing food and clothing to serving burial purposes. The [Thonet Brothers](/artist/thonet-brothers) (est. 1843) developed the first industrial-scale production processes for bentwood; their [Side Chair](/artwork/thonet-brothers-side-chair-production-no-19) is an iconic example of the technique.

Miniaturized representations of buildings are common throughout art history; Greek and Roman funerary art featured a tomb monument in the shape of a building with three sides (called naiskos in Greek and aedicula in Latin), which displayed images of the deceased and their families. In the medieval period, shrines in the form of human-sized Gothic cathedrals emerged.

Variations on this practice have existed around the world, with early instances including ancient Egyptian papyrus painting, ancient Chinese silk painting, and medieval manuscripts. Greater standardization in watercolor production was furthered by the wide distribution of a list of usable pigments in 17th-century England and the invention of portable watercolor boxes in the early 18th century. Old Masters like [Albrecht Dürer](/artist/albrecht-durer) and [Sir Anthony Van Dyck](/artist/sir-anthony-van-dyck) used the medium primarily for landscapes, though often as a delicate accent in ink and chalk drawings. Watercolor gained its strongest standing in the United Kingdom, with watercolorists gaining admission to the Royal Academy by the end of the 18th century and [J. M. W.

In this period, artistic patronage shifted increasingly towards the capitalist bourgeoisie and national academies, with a rising profile for art dealers and critics. The hub of Western artistic activity was Paris, and the French Academy and Salon represented the establishment, favoring [Neoclassicism](/gene/neoclassicism) at the beginning of the century and later [Romanticism](/gene/romanticism). Social and political commentary appeared in the history paintings of [Théodore Géricault](/artist/theodore-gericault) and [Francisco Goya](/artist/francisco-jose-de-goya-y-lucientes-1) as well as the Social Realist works of [Gustave Courbet](/artist/gustave-courbet) and [Honoré Daumier](/artist/honore-daumier).

Japan's opening to global trade and the subsequent arrival of Japanese objects in Europe were a significant influence. At the same time, photography emerged as a means of documenting social realities and an art form accessible to non-elites. Architecture was characterized by the use of new industrial materials and techniques, on the the one hand, and the revival of Classical and Gothic styles, on the other. In design and decorative arts, the [Arts and Crafts Movement](/gene/arts-and-crafts-movement) and [Art Nouveau](/gene/art-nouveau) both responded to industrialization and mass production through their emphasis on handmade craft and organic forms.

This was facilitated by British and Dutch trading companies in South Asia, the trade routes of the Ottoman Empire, and the Spanish administration of South America, amongst many other channels. China, Japan and Korea each experienced dramatic economic expansion and artistic flourishing, but while Chinese goods travelled widely through the global market, Japan maintained a closed economy. The great variety of artistic production in Europe in the 17th century is often loosely grouped under the term “[Baroque](/gene/baroque)”, which in general terms is characterized by a heightened sense of movement and lighting in compositions. In painting, these elements were perhaps first mastered by Caravaggio, who heavily influenced artists across Europe; amongst these were [Diego Velázquez](/artist/diego-velazquez) in Spain and and [Rembrandt](/artist/rembrandt-harmensz-van-rijn-1) in Holland. The exuberance of Baroque aesthetics combined with the fervor of the Catholic Counter-Reformation is evident in the re-constructed St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican, a project which was seen to completion by [Gian Lorenzo Bernini](/artist/gian-lorenzo-bernini). The taste for Baroque art travelled to the Americas, as evidenced by ornate religious buildings most notably in Mexico and Peru. In France, the century witnessed the consolidation of power under absolute monarchy, whose decadence was made visible in the construction of Louis XIV's royal palace at Versailles; the French Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture was also established under his rule. In the Dutch Republic, whose independence was gained from Spain after 80 years of conflict, an affluent mercantile class created the conditions for a dynamic art market with a preference for portraits, still lifes, cityscapes, and scenes of everyday life.

As a result, at the beginning of the decade, artists tended to look more outside the art world for their subject matter, which ranged from current issues such as the AIDS crisis, gun control, and homelessness to often-charged explorations of class, race, gender and sexual identity. This coincided with an emerging notion of artist as a kind of ethnographer, as well as an exploration of broken or grotesque bodies and identities, by the likes of [Paul McCarthy](/artist/paul-mccarthy) and [Kiki Smith](/artist/kiki-smith).

Rejecting the emotional intensity of artists like [Caspar David Friedrich](/artist/caspar-david-friedrich), these realists gravitated towards scenes of everyday life and investigations into the nature of reality. As keen observers of social interaction, they portrayed both rural and urban scenes, as well as the fashions of the newly emerging urban bourgeoisie. German Realism was not a coherent movement: it emerged alongside other national schools of realism (most prominently [19th Century French Realism](/gene/nineteenth-century-french-realism)) and was characterized by a broad array of individual styles. Adolph Menzel’s _The Iron Rolling Mill_ (1875) depicts a crowd of iron workers toiling over a hot furnace; it combines intense chiaroscuro with impressionistic passages of smoke. The much younger [Max Liebermann](/artist/max-liebermann), in contrast, painted airy scenes of beaches and parks with looser brushwork and a focus on light effects, which elicited comparisons to French Impressionism."

Equally indebted to mythologies of the [African Diaspora](/gene/african-diaspora), Afrofuturism is not an artistic style but an approach to the intersections of race and technology that aims to visualize the future. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, musicians (Sun Ra, Grace Jones, and Parliament Funkadelic), authors (Octavia Butler), and visual artists ([Renee Cox](/artist/renee-cox)) drew upon the futuristic energy of science fiction, seeing outer space as an escape from the oppressive social and political climate of the Vietnam war and post–Civil Rights era. Afrofuturism’s engagement with the African Diaspora is wide-ranging: photojournalist Cristina de Middel took the failed 1964 Zambian space program as the subject of her 2012 series [_Afronaut_](/artwork/cristina-de-middel-bambuit-from-the-series-the-afronauts).

Expressionist art was often characterized by spontaneous brushwork or mark-making, distorted figures, a progression towards abstraction, and a concentration on forms and ideas borrowed from myths and so-called “primitive art.” In reaction to the shock of urbanization and the machine age, many of these artists attempted to convey psychological states of isolation and alienation, or sought refuge in the idea of a spiritual art. In Vienna, [Egon Schiele](/artist/egon-schiele) created unsettling, sinuous portraits that evoked the anxiety of the age; in Germany, the formal experiments of [Wassily Kandinsky](/artist/wassily-kandinsky) combined new forms and color combinations with a focus on mysticism and expression; and in the field of architecture, Bruno Taut translated the utopian ideals of the tendency into fantastic buildings."

Within the socially conservative environment of late 19th- and early 20th-century Germany, groups like [The Blue Rider](/gene/the-blue-rider) and [Die Brücke](/gene/die-brucke) were shocking for both aesthetic and cultural reasons.

After the First World War, the utopian and spiritual elements of this tendency gave way to the more political ideas of groups like the Dresden Secession and the Novembergruppe, many of whose members later became associated with [Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity)](/gene/neue-sachlichkeit). Expressionism was a lightning-rod issue for Communists and National Socialists alike, for whom it often became a stand-in for Modern art at large. Considering it to be at odds with his program of classically inspired “Great German Art,” Adolph Hitler vilified the movement, holding it up as an emblem of cultural degeneration and persecuting its practitioners."

Using everything from mud and Elmer’s glue to plastic tubing and sound art, these artists strove to create new, vital experiences that blurred the boundaries between art and life. Early experiments, such as [Kazuo Shiraga](/artist/kazuo-shiraga)’s calligraphic paintings made by smearing paint around on a canvas, evoking the gestural abstraction of [Jackson Pollock](/artist/jackson-pollock) or [Art Informel](/gene/art-informel), were soon followed by an emphasis on performances, immersive installations, and video. For a nation recently defeated in World War II and emerging from the shadow of totalitarianism, Gutai’s call for vitality, play, and new artistic frontiers served as a jolt to a culture of consensus. The group actively promoted itself abroad through the distribution of mail art and a well-circulated journal, and in 1958 prominent New York dealer Martha Jackson staged an exhibition of their work. Gutai’s focus on performance and materiality has often been cited as a precursor to [Arte Povera](/gene/arte-povera) and [performance art](/gene/performance-art) of the 1960s."

Alongside [Arte Povera](/gene/arte-povera), the trans-avant-garde (Italian: transavanguardia) was one of Italy’s most important postwar artistic movements. Its name derives from Italian critic Achille Bonito Oliva’s 1981 essay entitled “The International Trans-Avant-Garde.” In this essay, Oliva named a small group of painters who, in the 1970s, departed from the dominant conceptual tendencies of the previous decade, exploring the expressive potential of painting with often universal or archaic motifs. This practice mirrored similar trends in expressive figurative painting across Europe and the United States, leading to the group’s frequent inclusion in discussions of 1980s [Neo-Expressionism](/gene/neo-expressionism). For Oliva, the trans-avant-garde rejected the original avant-garde’s “hysteria for the new” by returning to styles of the past. Indeed these artists quoted avidly not only from art history and classical mythology, but also popular culture and national symbolism.

Named after the medieval Bauhütten, or masons’ lodges, and inspired by the ideas of John Ruskin and William Morris, the Bauhaus is best known for reintroducing workshop training in lieu of traditional studio art education; unifying artistic creativity and manufacturing; emphasizing functionalism in architecture; and revolutionizing streamlined industrial design.

Invented and pursued by [Pablo Picasso](/artist/pablo-picasso) and [Georges Braque](/artist/georges-braque) in Paris between 1907 and 1914 and inspired by the simplified landscapes of [Paul Cézanne](/artist/paul-cezanne), Cubism took the revolutionary step of rejecting the 500-year-old idea that a painting was like a window, thus ruled by perspective. Instead, Picasso and Braque created more conceptual, subjective paintings that sought to represent the underlying structure of existence. The best-known Cubist works look like shattered glass in dim browns and yellows, and are composed of various sharp planes that combine to form people or objects. Cubism took its name from an insult delivered by the critic Louis Vauxcelles, who commented that one of Braque’s paintings looked as if it were “full of little cubes.” After 1910, Picasso and Braque’s Cubism was quickly adopted by many other artists in Paris and beyond and ended up being the primary influence on most or all abstract art before the outbreak of World War II."

The major creative influence within the group was Mondrian, who in pursuit of a purer nonobjective abstraction (lacking a representational tie to any object or form) than that achieved in [Cubism](/gene/cubism), created reductive works composed of only straight lines, rectangles, and blocks of primary colors. The organizational principles and aesthetic look of Mondrian’s canvases are taken into three dimensions in De Stijl architecture, such as Gerrit Rietveld’s 1924 Schröder House, in Utrecht.

Striving to capture the transient aspects of visual reality, especially light and color, Impressionists&mdash;the most familiar being [Claude Monet](/artist/claude-monet) and [Pierre Auguste Renoir](/artist/pierre-auguste-renoir)&mdash;emphasized firsthand observation of their subjects and focused on landscapes and everyday urban scenes. Like many subsequent avant-garde movements, it derived its name from a derisive label applied in a negative review.

Japanese objects were especially fashionable in Paris and London, and the term Japonisme was coined in 1872 by Parisian critic Phillippe Burty, whose vast collection of Japanese artworks drew the attention of [Edgar Degas](/artist/edgar-degas) and numerous Impressionists. Japanese aesthetics, as exemplified by _Ukiyo-e_ (""Pictures of the Floating World""), inspired asymmetric compositions, flattened modeling, calligraphic brushstrokes, pure bright colors, and the representation of transient, everyday scenes.

Capitalist Realism was launched in 1963 in Germany by the artists [Gerhard Richter](/artist/gerhard-richter), [Sigmar Polke](/artist/sigmar-polke), and Konrad Lueg (later to become the dealer Konrad Fischer) not as a movement, but rather as a send-up. Its most iconic expression was a performance titled “Living with Pop – A Demonstration for Capitalist Realism,” orchestrated by Richter and Lueg in the Berges department store in Dusseldorf that same year. The artists invited patrons to come view “what is hailed in America as the greatest breakthrough in art since Cubism,” as an advertisement for the event proclaimed. Puzzled visitors arrived to find the artists making themselves at home in a staged and decidedly average living room (Richter was reading a mystery novel). Of course Capitalist Realism had no such reputation in the U.S.; the artists were parodying the overnight ascendance of [Pop Art](/gene/pop-art), with its celebrity culture and embrace of everyday commodities, as well as the German craze for all things American.

Such works are usually site specific—created for and utilizing aspects or characteristics of a particular location. Both American and European artists began to use dirt, rocks, and sand as media and subject matter in the late 1960s, experimenting with diverse approaches. In 1967 the English artist Richard Long walked up and down a stretch of meadow over and over, creating a visible path depicted in the photograph _A Line Made by Walking_. This understated meditation on the symmetry and grace of a simple landscape contrasts with Land Art works that seek to dramatically alter a site, such as [Robert Smithson](/artist/robert-smithson)’s well-known 1970 sculpture and film, _Spiral Jetty_, which uses 7,000 tons of basalt, boulders, mud, and salt crystals mined from the area around Rozel Point, Great Salt Lake, Utah, to form a massive spiral winding 450 meters from the lake shore. Some of these works address ecological issues like those concerning activists in the 1960s. Alan Sonfist’s _Time Landscape_, for instance, which he proposed in 1965 and implemented in 1978, re-creates the original landscape on a small plot in Manhattan, calling attention to what is lost through urbanization and development.

In contrast to what they saw as the dark, overwrought academic painting of their contemporaries like [Joshua Reynolds](/artist/sir-joshua-reynolds), the Pre-Raphaelites emphasized naturalism and light. Their subject matter was often borrowed from literary sources such as the Bible, William Shakespeare, and John Keats, with underlying moral themes of piety, justice, and family.

The Swiss artist Max Bill, a major exponent of Concrete Art, had significant exhibitions in São Paulo, Brazil in the early 1950s, inspiring a younger generation of artists there.

The merging of art and life was crucial: painting was to be removed from its frame, sculpture taken down from its pedestal, and the work constantly subject to re-invention by its viewers. This led to developments in participatory and immersive art, as exemplified by Oiticica's penetrable environments and wearable sculptures or Pape's envisioning of a world without words in _Book of Creation_.

Additionally, many Brutalist structures' functional components (such as water tanks, electrical towers, and support pillars) are left exposed on the outside of the building. As an architectural philosophy, Brutalism was often associated with utopian socialist ideology.

In the works of master painters [Cimabue](/artist/cimabue) and [Duccio](/artist/duccio) in 13th-century Italy, where this technique emerged, the surface would then be embellished with incised lines and small, ornamental stamps, often visible in the halos of the deities depicted in the foreground of paintings in tempera paint.

The prophet Muhummad's revelations, which were recorded as the contents of the Qu'ran, occurred in the early part of the 7th century. During the spread of Islam in subsequent centuries, a legible script printed on parchment was essential for transporting and sharing the Qu'ran. In the 9th century, paper became the preferred medium, which led to the development of a more fluid, cursive script in place of the more angular style of the past; paper permitted not only the spread of religious texts, but also the publishing of large numbers of secular books. Farsi calligraphy reached its height around 1400 AD and was regularly used for poetry. While Arabic continued to be the language of sacred texts, Farsi was considered the language of highest literary merit, even as far away as the Ottoman and Mughal empires (present-day Turkey and India, respectively). Images of God were forbidden by the Qu'ran, and figurative art was often suspected of idolatry, so calligraphy is amongst the highest art forms in the Muslim world. Contemporary uses of calligraphy can be found in [Ghada Amer](/artist/ghada-amer)'s sculptures, [Shirin Neshat](/artist/shirin-neshat-2)'s photography, and [Shahzia Sikhander](/artist/shahzia-sikander)'s drawings and paintings.

Explorations of chance and the potential of the unconscious were central to both [Surrealism](/gene/surrealism) as well artists of later generations, like the [Abstract Expressionists](/gene/abstract-expressionism). [Ellsworth Kelly](/artist/ellsworth-kelly), for one, is well-known for choosing the colors for his grid paintings by rolling dice. The 1960s [Happenings](/gene/happenings) associated with [Fluxus](/gene/fluxus) and others introduced a new element of chance into art-making, with [John Cage](/artist/john-cage) famously using flipped coins as a means of composing musical scores."
529500f7cd530e8af5000044,http://artsy.net/gene/research-as-art,Research as Art,Visual Design and Method,"Works that foreground extensive research into individual, social, cultural, or scientific objects of inquiry. While there are many historic precedents for this type of presenting research in art—such as [Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier](/artist/jean-louis-ernest-meissonier)’s rigorous study of the movement of horses—(in some respects, all great art is the product of extensive research), since the 1990s, art has often approximated academic or journalistic inquiry in its attempts to contribute to knowledge, engage the public, and bring awareness to causes or subjects. The photographs of [Taryn Simon](/artist/taryn-simon), for example, are typically the culmination of years of research; in _A Living Man Declared Dead and Other Chapters_ (2011), the artist traveled around the world, tracing, and then documenting, bloodlines. This notion of research as art differs from traditional scholarship in that it is not characteristically beholden to disciplinary conventions and parameters, and may present “findings” in visually aesthetic formats or those otherwise atypical of academic or journalistic publications.

Examples include the incorporation of calligraphy into paintings and the use of embroidery or weaving, for instance, in the textile works of [Alighiero e Boetti](/artist/alighiero-e-boetti) or the digitally spun tapestries of [Pae White](/artist/pae-white). These works often blur the boundary between art and craft, representing a hybrid of cultural traditions."
5473a50a72616956777c0100,http://artsy.net/gene/mediated-view,Mediated View,Visual Design and Method,"Scenes, objects, or imagery seen through a frame, screen, or other visible layer. This technique can often serve to frame, alter, or obscure one’s view, adding a sense of mystery or depth to a work of art. One of the most frequent ways artists achieve this effect is by depicting scenes seen through a window or from behind a screen. In the history of art, paintings of windows have often been used to symbolically demarcate inside and outside, public and private, background and foreground. Northern Renaissance, Impressionist, and Fauvist artists, such as [Henri Matisse](http://www.artsy.net/artist/henri-matisse), frequently depicted scenes through windows to mediate and direct the viewer’s attention or to play with the idea of a painting as a “window onto the world,” a convention that has existed since the invention of one-point perspective. Perhaps the most famous example from art history is [Marcel Duchamp](http://www.artsy.net/artist/marcel-duchamp)’s Étant donnés (1946–66), an unsettling diorama of a female nude sprawled over a landscape. The sculpture itself is situated behind what appears to be a wooden door in a wall of the Philadelphia Museum of Art; the only way to see the scene is to look through a tiny slit in the door.

For many artists, even the purest abstraction is derived from nature—indeed, to invent the first non-objective painting in 1913, [Wassily Kandinsky](/artist/wassily-kandinsky) channeled his love of nature as an experience of color. Countless artists since, [Abstract Expressionist](/gene/abstract-expressionism) Frankenthaler included, have captured the [landscape](/gene/landscape) not in a literal likeness, but rather in its forms, colors, effects, or the subjective experience it gives rise to."
